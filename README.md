# ISP-Project - Brick Breaker Game
Our ISP Project goal is to make a game where the player's objective is to move a bed of brick so that a free-moving ball hits and "breaks" as many bricks as possible.
# Vision Statement
Our vision is to develop a game that serves as a form of entertainment. This will be done in these stages and restrictions.

Environment:
This project will be worked on by the 4 people listed as contributors, mainly inside the class, but also outside the classroom if need be to finish before deadlines etc.

Design:
The brick breaker game will be designed prior to development and writing of the code in order to maintain a plan/guide for the final result that the group will strive for.

Development:
Development of the game and its components will be coded in Python.
